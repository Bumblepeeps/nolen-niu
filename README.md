Nolen Niu furniture designer one-page scrolling site with parallax, photo-centric

Using HTML, CSS, and JS snippets, I created a full-screen experience to feature the furniture design of Nolen Niu.
Full focus on his pieces is achieved by immersing visitors in closeup photography of his pieces and textures and with linear navigation on a one-page layout. The site uses bootstrap for responsive design, and smoothscroll JS.

This project repository will also include a video showcasing the site.
